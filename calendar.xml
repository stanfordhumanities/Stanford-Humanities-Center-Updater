&lt;br /&gt;Event Description: Adams Bodomo will look at what has often been termed &amp;quot;Africa&amp;#39;s newest diaspora&amp;quot; by reviewing contemporary Africa - China relations. Closer official interactions between these two areas have led to an increasing number of Africans visiting, settling, and forming communities in China. Bodomo will share the results of a study he undertook with 700 Africans across six main Chinese cities. The research addresses many aspects of everyday life of Africans in China, from why Africans go to China to how they are received by the Chinese state and certainly has theoretical implications for cross-cultural and cross-linguistic studies in an era of globalization.

Adams Bodomo is African Studies Programme Director at the School of Humanities, University of Hong Kong. He obtained his PhD from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology after obtaining Bachelors and Masters Degrees at the University of Ghana.  Dr Bodomo has given invited lectures on the topic of Africans in China and on general Africa - China relations studies at several leading universities, including Yale University, SOAS, and Peking University. His latest book is entitled: &amp;quot;Africans in China: An Investigation into the African Presence in China and its Consequences on Africa - China Relations&amp;quot; (in press with Cambria Press, NY).</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=aWlyMGwxMjg0bWFhYzNmOWM4cmVqcjhmNWMgc3RhbmZvcmQuaHVtYW5pdGllcy5ldmVudHNAbQ' title='alternate'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/stanford.humanities.events%40gmail.com/public/basic/iir0l1284maac3f9c8rejr8f5c'/><author><name>stanford.humanities.events@gmail.com</name><email>stanford.humanities.events@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/stanford.humanities.events%40gmail.com/public/basic/r4arcsa2b3r5ohis9ld30r63e4</id><published>2011-09-28T16:28:17.000Z</published><updated>2011-09-28T16:28:17.000Z</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event'/><title type='html'>Documentary Film Maker Helen Whitney in Conversation with Marilyn Yalom</title><summary type='html'>When: Wed Nov 9, 2011 4pm to 6pm&amp;nbsp;

&lt;br /&gt;Event Description: SiCa-Humanites Center Arts writer/practitioner M.K. Raina in conversation with Asst. Drama Professor Jisha Menon: 

Salon featuring M.K. Raina
  
Raina will discuss his creative work in theatre, experimental and mainstream cinema, and documentary film. He will discuss his role as founder and member of Sahmat, a cultural NGO, formed in the wake of the assassination of street theatre activist, Safdar Hashmi. He will also address his cultural activism in Kashmir: his work with the folk Bhand performers, with the rehabilitation of orphaned Kashmiri children, and with the setting up of educational opportunities for performers (especially children) in the Kashmir Valley. 

M.K. Raina is one of the most distinguished theatre practitioners in India today. He is a graduate of India’s premier theatre institution, the National School of Drama based in New Delhi and his unique talents have been recognized by India’s highest awards, including the B.V. Karanth Award for Lifetime Achievement in Theatre in 2007. One of the few Indian artists who tackles the complex questions of human rights, democracy, and militant terror in the Kashmir valley--his birthplace--his work is informed by his dynamic engagement in secular activism and ranges from Kashmiri folk theatre (working with the Bhand Pather, Kashmiri folk performers) to classical Hindustani and avant-garde cinema. He was nominated by the Centre for South Asia. M.K. Raina will be present on campus during the month of October 2011.
